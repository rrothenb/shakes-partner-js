Hes speaking now, Or murmuring Wheres my serpent of old Nile For so he calls me: now I feed myself With most delicious poison. Think on me, That am with Phoebus amorous pinches black, And wrinkled deep in time Broadfronted Caesar, When thou wast here above the ground, I was A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow There would he anchor his aspect and die With looking on his life."
