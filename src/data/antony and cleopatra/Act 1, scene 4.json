Let us grant, it is not Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy To give a kingdom for a mirth to sit And keep the turn of tippling with a slave To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet With knaves that smell of sweat: say this becomes him, As his composure must be rare indeed Whom these things cannot blemish,yet must Antony No way excuse his soils, when we do bear So great weight in his lightness. If he filld His vacancy with his voluptuousness, Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones, Call on him fort: but to confound such time, That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud As his own state and ours,tis to be chid As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge, Pawn their experience to their present pleasure, And so rebel to judgment."

When thou once Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slewst Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel Did famine follow whom thou foughtst against, Though daintily brought up, with patience more Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign The roughest berry on the rudest hedge Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets, The barks of trees thou browsedst on the Alps It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh, Which some did die to look on: and all this It wounds thine honour that I speak it now Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek So much as lankd not."
