Tripleturnd whore! tis thou Hast sold me to this novice and my heart Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly For when I am revenged upon my charm, I have done all. Bid them all fly begone. O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more: Fortune and Antony part here even here Do we shake hands. All come to this The hearts That spanield me at heels, to whom I gave Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets On blossoming Caesar and this pine is barkd, That overtoppd them all. Betrayd I am: O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm, Whose eye beckd forth my wars, and calld them home Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end, Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose, Beguiled me to the very heart of loss. What, Eros, Eros! Ah, thou spell! Avaunt!"

Tis well thourt gone, If it be well to live but better twere Thou fellst into my fury, for one death Might have prevented many. Eros, ho! The shirt of Nessus is upon me: teach me, Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage: Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o the moon And with those hands, that graspd the heaviest club, Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die: To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall Under this plot she dies fort. Eros, ho!"
