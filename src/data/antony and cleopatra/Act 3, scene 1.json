Caesar and Antony have ever won More in their officer than person: Sossius, One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant, For quick accumulation of renown, Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour. Who does i the wars more than his captain can Becomes his captains captain: and ambition, The soldiers virtue, rather makes choice of loss, Than gain which darkens him. I could do more to do Antonius good, But twould offend him and in his offence Should my performance perish."
