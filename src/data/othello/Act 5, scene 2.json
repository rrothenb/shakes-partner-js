Yet Ill not shed her blood Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow, And smooth as monumental alabaster. Yet she must die, else shell betray more men. Put out the light, and then put out the light: If I quench thee, thou flaming minister, I can again thy former light restore, Should I repent me: but once put out thy light, Thou cunningst pattern of excelling nature, I know not where is that Promethean heat That can thy light relume. When I have pluckd the rose, I cannot give it vital growth again. It must needs wither: Ill smell it on the tree. Ah balmy breath, that dost almost persuade Justice to break her sword! One more, one more. Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee, And love thee after. One more, and this the last: So sweet was neer so fatal. I must weep, But they are cruel tears: this sorrows heavenly It strikes where it doth love. She wakes."

To you, lord governor, Remains the censure of this hellish villain The time, the place, the torture: O, enforce it! Myself will straight aboard: and to the state This heavy act with heavy heart relate. To sing a song that old was sung, From ashes ancient Gower is come Assuming mans infirmities, To glad your ear, and please your eyes. It hath been sung at festivals, On embereves and holyales And lords and ladies in their lives Have read it for restoratives: The purchase is to make men glorious Et bonum quo antiquius, eo melius. If you, born in these latter times, When wits more ripe, accept my rhymes. And that to hear an old man sing May to your wishes pleasure bring I life would wish, and that I might Waste it for you, like taperlight. This Antioch, then, Antiochus the Great Built up, this city, for his chiefest seat: The fairest in all Syria, I tell you what mine authors say: This king unto him took a fere, Who died and left a female heir, So buxom, blithe, and full of face, As heaven had lent her all his grace With whom the father liking took, And her to incest did provoke: Bad child worse father! to entice his own To evil should be done by none: But custom what they did begin Was with long use account no sin. The beauty of this sinful dame Made many princes thither frame, To seek her as a bedfellow, In marriagepleasures playfellow: Which to prevent he made a law, To keep her still, and men in awe, That whoso askd her for his wife, His riddle told not, lost his life: So for her many a wight did die, As yon grim looks do testify. What now ensues, to the judgment of your eye I give, my cause who best can justify."
