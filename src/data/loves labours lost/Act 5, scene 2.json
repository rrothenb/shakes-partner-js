Their herald is a pretty knavish page, That well by heart hath connd his embassage: Action and accent did they teach him there Thus must thou speak, and thus thy body bear: And ever and anon they made a doubt Presence majestical would put him out, For, quoth the king, an angel shalt thou see Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously. The boy replied, An angel is not evil I should have feard her had she been a devil. With that, all laughd and clappd him on the shoulder, Making the bold wag by their praises bolder: One rubbd his elbow thus, and fleerd and swore A better speech was never spoke before Another, with his finger and his thumb, Cried, Via! we will dot, come what will come The third he caperd, and cried, All goes well The fourth turnd on the toe, and down he fell.

When shepherds pipe on oaten straws And merry larks are ploughmens clocks, When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws, And maidens bleach their summer smocks The cuckoo then, on every tree, Mocks married men for thus sings he, Cuckoo Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear, Unpleasing to a married ear! WINTER. When icicles hang by the wall And Dick the shepherd blows his nail And Tom bears logs into the hall And milk comes frozen home in pail, When blood is nippd and ways be foul, Then nightly sings the staring owl, Tuwhit Tuwho, a merry note, While greasy Joan doth keel the pot. When all aloud the wind doth blow And coughing drowns the parsons saw And birds sit brooding in the snow And Marians nose looks red and raw, When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl, Then nightly sings the staring owl, Tuwhit Tuwho, a merry note, While greasy Joan doth keel the pot. DON The words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of Apollo. You that way: we this way."
