Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men To turn their own points on their masters bosoms: Now Margarets curse is fallen upon my head When he, quoth she, shall split thy heart with sorrow, Remember Margaret was a prophetess. Come, sirs, convey me to the block of shame Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame."
