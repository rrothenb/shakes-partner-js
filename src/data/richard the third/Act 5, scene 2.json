The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar, That spoild your summer fields and fruitful vines, Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough In your embowelld bosoms, this foul swine Lies now even in the centre of this isle, Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn From Tamworth thither is but one days march. In Gods name, cheerly on, courageous friends, To reap the harvest of perpetual peace By this one bloody trial of sharp war."
