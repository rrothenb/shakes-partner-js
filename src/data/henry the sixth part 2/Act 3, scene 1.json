Small curs are not regarded when they grin But great men tremble when the lion roars And Humphrey is no little man in England. First note that he is near you in descent, And should you fall, he as the next will mount. Me seemeth then it is no policy, Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears And his advantage following your decease, That he should come about your royal person Or be admitted to your highness council. By flattery hath he won the commons hearts, And when he please to make commotion, Tis to be feard they all will follow him. Now tis the spring, and weeds are shallowrooted Suffer them now, and theyll oergrow the garden And choke the herbs for want of husbandry. The reverent care I bear unto my lord Made me collect these dangers in the duke. If it be fond, call it a womans fear Which fear if better reasons can supplant, I will subscribe and say I wrongd the duke. My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York, Reprove my allegation, if you can Or else conclude my words effectual."

And, for a minister of my intent, I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman, John Cade of Ashford, To make commotion, as full well he can, Under the title of John Mortimer. In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade Oppose himself against a troop of kerns, And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts Were almost like a sharpquilld porpentine And, in the end being rescued, I have seen Him caper upright like a wild Morisco, Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells. Full often, like a shaghaird crafty kern, Hath he conversed with the enemy, And undiscoverd come to me again And given me notice of their villanies. This devil here shall be my substitute For that John Mortimer, which now is dead, In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble: By this I shall perceive the commons mind, How they affect the house and claim of York. Say he be taken, rackd and tortured, I know no pain they can inflict upon him Will make him say I moved him to those arms. Say that he thrive, as tis great like he will, Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength And reap the harvest which that rascal sowd For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be, And Henry put apart, the next for me."
