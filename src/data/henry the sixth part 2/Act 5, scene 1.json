Ah! sancta majestas, who would not buy thee dear? Let them obey that know not how to rule; This hand was made to handle naught but gold. I cannot give due action to my words, Except a sword or sceptre balance it: A sceptre shall it have, have I a soul, On which I'll toss the flower-de-luce of France. Whom have we here? Buckingham, to disturb me? The king hath sent him, sure: I must dissemble."
