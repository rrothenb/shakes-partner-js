Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold. What, ist too short Ill lengthen it with mine: And, having both together heaved it up, Well both together lift our heads to heaven, And never more abase our sight so low As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground."

Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch: Gold cannot come amiss, were she a devil. Yet have I gold flies from another coast I dare not say, from the rich cardinal And from the great and newmade Duke of Suffolk, Yet I do find it so for to be plain, They, knowing Dame Eleanors aspiring humour, Have hired me to undermine the duchess And buz these conjurations in her brain. They say A crafty knave does need no broker Yet am I Suffolk and the cardinals broker. Hume, if you take not heed, you shall go near To call them both a pair of crafty knaves. Well, so it stands and thus, I fear, at last Humes knavery will be the duchess wreck, And her attainture will be Humphreys fall: Sort how it will, I shall have gold for all."
