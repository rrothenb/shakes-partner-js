As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs, When from thy shore the tempest beat us back, I stood upon the hatches in the storm, And when the dusky sky began to rob My earnestgaping sight of thy lands view, I took a costly jewel from my neck, A heart it was, bound in with diamonds, And threw it towards thy land: the sea received it, And so I wishd thy body might my heart: And even with this I lost fair Englands view And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart And calld them blind and dusky spectacles, For losing ken of Albions wished coast. How often have I tempted Suffolks tongue, The agent of thy foul inconstancy, To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did When he to madding Dido would unfold His fathers acts commenced in burning Troy!

Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence A wilderness is populous enough, So Suffolk had thy heavenly company: For where thou art, there is the world itself, With every several pleasure in the world, And where thou art not, desolation. I can no more: live thou to joy thy life Myself no joy in nought but that thou livest."

To die by thee were but to die in jest From thee to die were torture more than death: O, let me stay, befall what may befall!"
