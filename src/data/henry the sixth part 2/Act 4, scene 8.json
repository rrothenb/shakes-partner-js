Let them break your backs with burthens, take your houses over your heads, ravish your wives and daughters before your faces: for me, I will make shift for one and so, Gods curse light upon you all!"

Weret not a shame, that whilst you live at jar, The fearful French, whom you late vanquished, Should make a start oer seas and vanquish you Methinks already in this civil broil I see them lording it in London streets, Crying Villiago! unto all they meet. Better ten thousand baseborn Cades miscarry Than you should stoop unto a Frenchmans mercy. To France, to France, and get what you have lost Spare England, for it is your native coast Henry hath money, you are strong and manly God on our side, doubt not of victory."
