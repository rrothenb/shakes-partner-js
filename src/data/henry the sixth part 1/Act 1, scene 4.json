The princes espials have informed me How the English, in the suburbs close intrenchd, Wont, through a secret grate of iron bars In yonder tower, to overpeer the city, And thence discover how with most advantage They may vex us with shot, or with assault. To intercept this inconvenience, A piece of ordnance gainst it I have placed And even these three days have I watchd, If I could see them. Now do thou watch, for I can stay no longer. If thou spyst any, run and bring me word And thou shalt find me at the governors. Father, I warrant you take you no care Ill never trouble you, if I may spy them."

In open marketplace produced they me, To be a public spectacle to all: Here, said they, is the terror of the French, The scarecrow that affrights our children so. Then broke I from the officers that led me, And with my nails diggd stones out of the ground, To hurl at the beholders of my shame: My grisly countenance made others fly None durst come near for fear of sudden death. In iron walls they deemd me not secure So great fear of my name mongst them was spread, That they supposed I could rend bars of steel, And spurn in pieces posts of adamant: Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had, That walked about me every minutewhile And if I did but stir out of my bed, Ready they were to shoot me to the heart."

In thirteen battles Salisbury oercame Henry the Fifth he first traind to the wars Whilst any trump did sound, or drum struck up, His sword did neer leave striking in the field. Yet livest thou, Salisbury though thy speech doth fail, One eye thou hast, to look to heaven for grace: The sun with one eye vieweth all the world. Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive, If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands! Bear hence his body I will help to bury it. Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life Speak unto Talbot nay, look up to him. Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort Thou shalt not die whiles He beckons with his hand and smiles on me. As who should say When I am dead and gone, Remember to avenge me on the French. Plantagenet, I will and like thee, Nero, Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn: Wretched shall France be only in my name.

Convey me Salisbury into his tent, And then well try what these dastard Frenchmen dare. Where is my strength, my valour, and my force Our English troops retire, I cannot stay them: A woman clad in armour chaseth them. Here, here she comes.
