Then leaden age, Quickend with youthful spleen and warlike rage, Beat down Alencon, Orleans, Burgundy, And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee. The ireful bastard Orleans, that drew blood From thee, my boy, and had the maidenhood Of thy first fight, I soon encountered, And interchanging blows I quickly shed Some of his bastard blood and in disgrace Bespoke him thus Contaminated, base And misbegotten blood I spill of thine, Mean and right poor, for that pure blood of mine Which thou didst force from Talbot, my brave boy: Here, purposing the Bastard to destroy, Came in strong rescue. Speak, thy fathers care, Art thou not weary, John how dost thou fare Wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly, Now thou art seald the son of chivalry Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead: The help of one stands me in little stead. O, too much folly is it, well I wot, To hazard all our lives in one small boat! If I today die not with Frenchmens rage, Tomorrow I shall die with mickle age: By me they nothing gain an if I stay Tis but the shortening of my life one day: In thee thy mother dies, our households name, My deaths revenge, thy youth, and Englands fame: All these and more we hazard by thy stay All these are saved if thou wilt fly away."

And like me to the peasant boys of France, To be shames scorn and subject of mischance! Surely, by all the glory you have won, An if I fly, I am not Talbots son: Then talk no more of flight, it is no boot If son to Talbot, die at Talbots foot."

Where is my other life mine own is gone O, wheres young Talbot where is valiant John Triumphant death, smeard with captivity, Young Talbots valour makes me smile at thee: When he perceived me shrink and on my knee, His bloody sword he brandishd over me, And, like a hungry lion, did commence Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience But when my angry guardant stood alone, Tendering my ruin and assaild of none, Dizzyeyed fury and great rage of heart Suddenly made him from my side to start Into the clustering battle of the French And in that sea of blood my boy did drench His overmounting spirit, and there died, My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride."
