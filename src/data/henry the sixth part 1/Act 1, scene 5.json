They calld us for our fierceness English dogs Now, like to whelps, we crying run away. Hark, countrymen! either renew the fight, Or tear the lions out of Englands coat Renounce your soil, give sheep in lions stead: Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf, Or horse or oxen from the leopard, As you fly from your oftsubdued slaves. It will not be: retire into your trenches: You all consented unto Salisburys death, For none would strike a stroke in his revenge. Pucelle is enterd into Orleans, In spite of us or aught that we could do. O, would I were to die with Salisbury! The shame hereof will make me hide my head. Exit TALBOT. Alarum retreat flourish"
