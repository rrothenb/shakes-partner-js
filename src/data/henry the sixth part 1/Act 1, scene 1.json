Virtue he had, deserving to command: His brandishd sword did blind men with his beams: His arms spread wider than a dragons wings His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire, More dazzled and drove back his enemies Than midday sun fierce bent against their faces. What should I say his deeds exceed all speech: He neer lift up his hand but conquered."

The tenth of August last this dreadful lord, Retiring from the siege of Orleans, Having full scarce six thousand in his troop. By three and twenty thousand of the French Was round encompassed and set upon. No leisure had he to enrank his men He wanted pikes to set before his archers Instead whereof sharp stakes pluckd out of hedges They pitched in the ground confusedly, To keep the horsemen off from breaking in. More than three hours the fight continued Where valiant Talbot above human thought Enacted wonders with his sword and lance: Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew: The French exclaimd, the devil was in arms All the whole army stood agazed on him: His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain And rushd into the bowels of the battle. Here had the conquest fully been seald up, If Sir John Fastolfe had not playd the coward: He, being in the vaward, placed behind With purpose to relieve and follow them, Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke. Hence grew the general wreck and massacre Enclosed were they with their enemies: A base Walloon, to win the Dauphins grace, Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back, Whom all France with their chief assembled strength Durst not presume to look once in the face."
