Why should his mistress, who was made by him that made the tailor, not be fit too the rathersaving reverence of the wordfor tis said a womans fitness comes by fits. Therein I must play the workman. I dare speak it to myselffor it is not vainglory for a man and his glass to confer in his own chamberI mean, the lines of my body are as well drawn as his no less young, more strong, not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the advantage of the time, above him in birth, alike conversant in general services, and more remarkable in single oppositions: yet this imperceiverant thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is! Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thy shoulders, shall within this hour be off thy mistress enforced thy garments cut to pieces before thy face: and all this done, spurn her home to her father who may haply be a little angry for my so rough usage but my mother, having power of his testiness, shall turn all into my commendations. My horse is tied up safe: out, sword, and to a sore purpose! Fortune, put them into my hand! This is the very description of their meetingplace and the fellow dares not deceive me."
