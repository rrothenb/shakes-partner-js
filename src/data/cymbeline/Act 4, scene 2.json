Good faith, I tremble stiff with fear: but if there be Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity As a wrens eye, feard gods, a part of it!

O Posthumus! alas, Where is thy head wheres that Ay me! wheres that Pisanio might have killd thee at the heart, And left this head on. How should this be Pisanio Tis he and Cloten: malice and lucre in them Have laid this woe here. O, tis pregnant, pregnant! The drug he gave me, which he said was precious And cordial to me, have I not found it Murderous to the senses That confirms it home: This is Pisanios deed, and Clotens: O!
