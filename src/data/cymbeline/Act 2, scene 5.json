O, vengeance, vengeance! Me of my lawful pleasure she restraind And prayd me oft forbearance did it with A pudency so rosy the sweet view ont Might well have warmd old Saturn that I thought her As chaste as unsunnd snow. O, all the devils! This yellow Iachimo, in an hour,wast not Or less,at firstperchance he spoke not, but, Like a fullacornd boar, a German one, Cried O! and mounted found no opposition But what he lookd for should oppose and she Should from encounter guard. Could I find out The womans part in me! For theres no motion That tends to vice in man, but I affirm It is the womans part: be it lying, note it, The womans flattering, hers deceiving, hers Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers revenges, hers Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain, Nice longing, slanders, mutability, All faults that may be named, nay, that hell knows, Why, hers, in part or all but rather, all For even to vice They are not constant but are changing still One vice, but of a minute old, for one Not half so old as that. Ill write against them, Detest them, curse them: yet tis greater skill In a true hate, to pray they have their will: The very devils cannot plague them better."
