I dreamt my lady came and found me dead Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think! And breathed such life with kisses in my lips, That I revived, and was an emperor. Ah me! how sweet is love itself possessd, When but loves shadows are so rich in joy! News from Verona!How now, Balthasar! Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar How doth my lady Is my father well How fares my Juliet that I ask again For nothing can be ill, if she be well."

Lets see for means: O mischief, thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men! I do remember an apothecary, And hereabouts he dwells,which late I noted In tatterd weeds, with overwhelming brows, Culling of simples meagre were his looks, Sharp misery had worn him to the bones: And in his needy shop a tortoise hung, An alligator stuffd, and other skins Of illshaped fishes and about his shelves A beggarly account of empty boxes, Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds, Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses, Were thinly scatterd, to make up a show. Noting this penury, to myself I said An if a man did need a poison now, Whose sale is present death in Mantua, Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him. O, this same thought did but forerun my need And this same needy man must sell it me. As I remember, this should be the house. Being holiday, the beggars shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary!"
