Or illbeseeming beast in seeming both! Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order, I thought thy disposition better temperd. Hast thou slain Tybalt wilt thou slay thyself And stay thy lady too that lives in thee, By doing damned hate upon thyself Why railst thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet In thee at once which thou at once wouldst lose. Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit Which, like a usurer, aboundst in all, And usest none in that true use indeed Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit: Thy noble shape is but a form of wax, Digressing from the valour of a man Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury, Killing that love which thou hast vowd to cherish Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love, Misshapen in the conduct of them both, Like powder in a skitless soldiers flask, Is set afire by thine own ignorance, And thou dismemberd with thine own defence. What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive, For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee, But thou slewst Tybalt there are thou happy too: The law that threatend death becomes thy friend And turns it to exile there art thou happy: A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back Happiness courts thee in her best array But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench, Thou poutst upon thy fortune and thy love: Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable. Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed, Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her: But look thou stay not till the watch be set, For then thou canst not pass to Mantua Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends, Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back With twenty hundred thousand times more joy Than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady And bid her hasten all the house to bed, Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto: Romeo is coming."
