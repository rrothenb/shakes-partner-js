I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins, That almost freezes up the heat of life: Ill call them back again to comfort me: Nurse! What should she do here My dismal scene I needs must act alone. Come, vial. What if this mixture do not work at all Shall I be married then tomorrow morning No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there. What if it be a poison, which the friar Subtly hath ministerd to have me dead, Lest in this marriage he should be dishonourd, Because he married me before to Romeo I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not, For he hath still been tried a holy man. How if, when I am laid into the tomb, I wake before the time that Romeo Come to redeem me theres a fearful point! Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault, To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in, And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes Or, if I live, is it not very like, The horrible conceit of death and night, Together with the terror of the place, As in a vault, an ancient receptacle, Where, for these many hundred years, the bones Of all my buried ancestors are packed: Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth, Lies festering in his shroud where, as they say, At some hours in the night spirits resort Alack, alack, is it not like that I, So early waking, what with loathsome smells, And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth, That living mortals, hearing them, run mad: O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught, Environed with all these hideous fears And madly play with my forefathers joints And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud And, in this rage, with some great kinsmans bone, As with a club, dash out my desperate brains O, look! methinks I see my cousins ghost Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body Upon a rapiers point: stay, Tybalt, stay! Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee."
