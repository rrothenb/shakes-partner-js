The earth hath swallowd all my hopes but she, She is the hopeful lady of my earth: But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart, My will to her consent is but a part An she agree, within her scope of choice Lies my consent and fair according voice. This night I hold an old accustomd feast, Whereto I have invited many a guest, Such as I love and you, among the store, One more, most welcome, makes my number more. At my poor house look to behold this night Earthtreading stars that make dark heaven light: Such comfort as do lusty young men feel When wellapparelld April on the heel Of limping winter treads, even such delight Among fresh female buds shall you this night Inherit at my house hear all, all see, And like her most whose merit most shall be: Which on more view, of many mine being one May stand in number, though in reckoning none, Come, go with me. Go, sirrah, trudge about Through fair Verona find those persons out Whose names are written there, and to them say, My house and welcome on their pleasure stay."
