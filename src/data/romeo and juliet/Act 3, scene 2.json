Spread thy close curtain, loveperforming night, That runaways eyes may wink and Romeo Leap to these arms, untalkd of and unseen. Lovers can see to do their amorous rites By their own beauties or, if love be blind, It best agrees with night. Come, civil night, Thou sobersuited matron, all in black, And learn me how to lose a winning match, Playd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods: Hood my unmannd blood, bating in my cheeks, With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold, Think true love acted simple modesty. Come, night come, Romeo come, thou day in night For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night Whiter than new snow on a ravens back. Come, gentle night, come, loving, blackbrowd night, Give me my Romeo and, when he shall die, Take him and cut him out in little stars, And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night And pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of a love, But not possessd it, and, though I am sold, Not yet enjoyd: so tedious is this day As is the night before some festival To an impatient child that hath new robes And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse, And she brings news and every tongue that speaks But Romeos name speaks heavenly eloquence. Now, nurse, what news What hast thou there the cords That Romeo bid thee fetch"

My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain And Tybalts dead, that would have slain my husband: All this is comfort wherefore weep I then Some word there was, worser than Tybalts death, That murderd me: I would forget it fain But, O, it presses to my memory, Like damned guilty deeds to sinners minds: Tybalt is dead, and Romeobanished That banished, that one word banished, Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalts death Was woe enough, if it had ended there: Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship And needly will be rankd with other griefs, Why followd not, when she said Tybalts dead, Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both, Which modern lamentations might have moved But with a rearward following Tybalts death, Romeo is banished, to speak that word, Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, All slain, all dead. Romeo is banished! There is no end, no limit, measure, bound, In that words death no words can that woe sound. Where is my father, and my mother, nurse"
