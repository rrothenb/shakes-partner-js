She speaks poniards, and every word stabs: if her breath were as terrible as her terminations, there were no living near her she would infect to the north star. I would not marry her, though she were endowed with all that Adam bad left him before he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make the fire too. Come, talk not of her: you shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God some scholar would conjure her for certainly, while she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary and people sin upon purpose, because they would go thither so, indeed, all disquiet, horror and perturbation follows her."
