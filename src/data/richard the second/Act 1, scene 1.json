Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee, And mark my greeting well for what I speak My body shall make good upon this earth, Or my divine soul answer it in heaven. Thou art a traitor and a miscreant, Too good to be so and too bad to live, Since the more fair and crystal is the sky, The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly. Once more, the more to aggravate the note, With a foul traitors name stuff I thy throat And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move, What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove."

Setting aside his high bloods royalty, And let him be no kinsman to my liege, I do defy him, and I spit at him Call him a slanderous coward and a villain: Which to maintain I would allow him odds, And meet him, were I tied to run afoot Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps, Or any other ground inhabitable, Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.

Besides I say and will in battle prove, Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge That ever was surveyd by English eye, That all the treasons for these eighteen years Complotted and contrived in this land Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring. Further I say and further will maintain Upon his bad life to make all this good, That he did plot the Duke of Gloucesters death, Suggest his soonbelieving adversaries, And consequently, like a traitor coward, Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood: Which blood, like sacrificing Abels, cries, Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth, To me for justice and rough chastisement And, by the glorious worth of my descent, This arm shall do it, or this life be spent."

For Gloucesters death, I slew him not but to my own disgrace Neglected my sworn duty in that case. For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster, The honourable father to my foe Once did I lay an ambush for your life, A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul But ere I last received the sacrament I did confess it, and exactly beggd Your graces pardon, and I hope I had it. This is my fault: as for the rest appealld, It issues from the rancour of a villain, A recreant and most degenerate traitor Which in myself I boldly will defend And interchangeably hurl down my gage Upon this overweening traitors foot, To prove myself a loyal gentleman Even in the best blood chamberd in his bosom. In haste whereof, most heartily I pray Your highness to assign our trial day."
