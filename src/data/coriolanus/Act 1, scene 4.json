All the contagion of the south light on you, You shames of Rome! you herd ofBoils and plagues Plaster you oer, that you may be abhorrd Further than seen and one infect another Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese, That bear the shapes of men, how have you run From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell! All hurt behind backs red, and faces pale With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home, Or, by the fires of heaven, Ill leave the foe And make my wars on you: look tot: come on If youll stand fast, well beat them to their wives, As they us to our trenches followed. So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds: Tis for the followers fortune widens them, Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like."
