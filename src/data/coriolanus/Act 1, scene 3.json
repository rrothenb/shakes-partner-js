When yet he was but tenderbodied and the only son of my womb, when youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when for a day of kings entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering how honour would become such a person. that it was no better than picturelike to hang by the wall, if renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel war I sent him from whence he returned, his brows bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a manchild than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man."
