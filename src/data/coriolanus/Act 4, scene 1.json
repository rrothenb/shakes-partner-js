Farewell, my wife, my mother: Ill do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius, Thy tears are salter than a younger mans, And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general, I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld Hearthardening spectacles tell these sad women Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes, As tis to laugh at em. My mother, you wot well My hazards still have been your solace: and Believet not lightlythough I go alone, Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen Makes feard and talkd of more than seenyour son Will or exceed the common or be caught With cautelous baits and practise."
