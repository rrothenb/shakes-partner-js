Their latest refuge Was to send him for whose old love I have, Though I showd sourly to him, once more offerd The first conditions, which they did refuse And cannot now accept to grace him only That thought he could do more, a very little I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits, Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow In the same time tis made I will not. My wife comes foremost then the honourd mould Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection! All bond and privilege of nature, break! Let it be virtuous to be obstinate. What is that curtsy worth or those doves eyes, Which can make gods forsworn I melt, and am not Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows As if Olympus to a molehill should In supplication nod: and my young boy Hath an aspect of intercession, which Great nature cries Deny not. let the Volsces Plough Rome and harrow Italy: Ill never Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand, As if a man were author of himself And knew no other kin."

And to poor we Thine enmitys most capital: thou barrst us Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort That all but we enjoy for how can we, Alas, how can we for our country pray. Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory, Whereto we are bound alack, or we must lose The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person, Our comfort in the country.

If it were so that our request did tend To save the Romans, thereby to destroy The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us, As poisonous of your honour: no our suit Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces May say This mercy we have showd the Romans, This we received and each in either side Give the allhail to thee and cry Be blest For making up this peace! Thou knowst, great son, The end of wars uncertain, but this certain, That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name, Whose repetition will be doggd with curses Whose chronicle thus writ: The man was noble, But with his last attempt he wiped it out Destroyd his country, and his name remains To the ensuing age abhorrd. Speak to me, son: Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour, To imitate the graces of the gods To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o the air, And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak Thinkst thou it honourable for a noble man Still to remember wrongs Daughter, speak you: He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy: Perhaps thy childishness will move him more Than can our reasons. Theres no man in the world More bound to s mother yet here he lets me prate Like one i the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life Showd thy dear mother any courtesy, When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood, Has cluckd thee to the wars and safely home, Loaden with honour. Say my requests unjust, And spurn me back: but if it be not so, Thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee, That thou restrainst from me the duty which To a mothers part belongs. He turns away: Down, ladies let us shame him with our knees. To his surname Coriolanus longs more pride Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end This is the last: so we will home to Rome, And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold s: This boy, that cannot tell what he would have But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship, Does reason our petition with more strength Than thou hast to deny t. Come, let us go: This fellow had a Volscian to his mother His wife is in Corioli and his child Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch: I am hushd until our city be afire, And then Ill speak a little."
