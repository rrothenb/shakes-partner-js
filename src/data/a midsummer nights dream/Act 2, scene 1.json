The cowslips tall her pensioners be: In their gold coats spots you see Those be rubies, fairy favours, In those freckles live their savours: I must go seek some dewdrops here And hang a pearl in every cowslips ear. Farewell, thou lob of spirits Ill be gone: Our queen and all our elves come here anon."

The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale, Sometime for threefoot stool mistaketh me Then slip I from her bum, down topples she, And tailor cries, and falls into a cough And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh, And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear A merrier hour was never wasted there.

Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain, As in revenge, have suckd up from the sea Contagious fogs which falling in the land Have every pelting river made so proud That they have overborne their continents: The ox hath therefore stretchd his yoke in vain, The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn Hath rotted ere his youth attaind a beard The fold stands empty in the drowned field, And crows are fatted with the murrion flock The nine mens morris is filld up with mud, And the quaint mazes in the wanton green For lack of tread are undistinguishable: The human mortals want their winter here No night is now with hymn or carol blest: Therefore the moon, the governess of floods, Pale in her anger, washes all the air, That rheumatic diseases do abound: And thorough this distemperature we see The seasons alter: hoaryheaded frosts Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose, And on old Hiems thin and icy crown An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer, The childing autumn, angry winter, change Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world, By their increase, now knows not which is which: And this same progeny of evils comes From our debate, from our dissension We are their parents and original."

Yet markd I where the bolt of Cupid fell: It fell upon a little western flower, Before milkwhite, now purple with loves wound, And maidens call it loveinidleness.
