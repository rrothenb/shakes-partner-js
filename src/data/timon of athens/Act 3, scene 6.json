For your own gifts, make yourselves praised: but reserve still to give, lest your deities be despised. Lend to each man enough, that one need not lend to another for, were your godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake the gods. Make the meat be beloved more than the man that gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be without a score of villains: if there sit twelve women at the table, let a dozen of them beas they are. The rest of your fees, O godsthe senators of Athens, together with the common lag of peoplewhat is amiss in them, you gods, make suitable for destruction.
