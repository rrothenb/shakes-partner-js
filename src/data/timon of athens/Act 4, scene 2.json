More of our fellows."

Wherever we shall meet, for Timons sake, Lets yet be fellows lets shake our heads, and say, As twere a knell unto our masters fortunes, We have seen better days. Let each take some Nay, put out all your hands. Not one word more: Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor. O, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us! Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt, Since riches point to misery and contempt Who would be so mockd with glory or to live But in a dream of friendship To have his pomp and all what state compounds But only painted, like his varnishd friends Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart, Undone by goodness! Strange, unusual blood, When mans worst sin is, he does too much good! Who, then, dares to be half so kind again For bounty, that makes gods, does still mar men. My dearest lord, blessd, to be most accursed, Rich, only to be wretched, thy great fortunes Are made thy chief afflictions. Alas, kind lord! Hes flung in rage from this ingrateful seat Of monstrous friends, nor has he with him to Supply his life, or that which can command it. Ill follow and inquire him out: Ill ever serve his mind with my best will Whilst I have gold, Ill be his steward still. O blessed breeding sun, draw from the earth Rotten humidity below thy sisters orb Infect the air! Twinnd brothers of one womb, Whose procreation, residence, and birth, Scarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes The greater scorns the lesser: not nature, To whom all sores lay siege, can bear great fortune, But by contempt of nature. Raise me this beggar, and deny t that lord The senator shall bear contempt hereditary, The beggar native honour. It is the pasture lards the rothers sides, The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares, In purity of manhood stand upright, And say This mans a flatterer if one be, So are they all for every grise of fortune Is smoothd by that below: the learned pate Ducks to the golden fool: all is oblique Theres nothing level in our cursed natures, But direct villany. Therefore, be abhorrd All feasts, societies, and throngs of men! His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains: Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots! Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate With thy most operant poison! What is here Gold yellow, glittering, precious gold No, gods, I am no idle votarist: roots, you clear heavens! Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair, Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant. Ha, you gods! why this what this, you gods Why, this Will lug your priests and servants from your sides, Pluck stout mens pillows from below their heads: This yellow slave Will knit and break religions, bless the accursed, Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves And give them title, knee and approbation With senators on the bench: this is it That makes the wappend widow wed again She, whom the spitalhouse and ulcerous sores Would cast the gorge at, this embalms and spices To the April day again. Come, damned earth, Thou common whore of mankind, that putst odds Among the route of nations, I will make thee Do thy right nature. Ha! a drum  Thourt quick, But yet Ill bury thee: thoult go, strong thief, When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand. Nay, stay thou out for earnest."
