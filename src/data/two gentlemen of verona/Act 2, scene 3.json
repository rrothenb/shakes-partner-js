I have received my proportion, like the prodigious son, and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperials court. I think Crab, my dog, be the sourestnatured dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat wringing her hands, and all our house in a great perplexity, yet did not this cruelhearted cur shed one tear: he is a stone, a very pebble stone, and has no more pity in him than a dog: a Jew would have wept to have seen our parting why, my grandam, having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my parting. Nay, Ill show you the manner of it. This shoe is my father: no, this left shoe is my father: no, no, this left shoe is my mother: nay, that cannot be so neither: yes, it is so, it is so, it hath the worser sole. This shoe, with the hole in it, is my mother, and this my father a vengeance ont! there tis: now, sit, this staff is my sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily and as small as a wand: this hat is Nan, our maid: I am the dog: no, the dog is himself, and I am the dogOh! the dog is me, and I am myself ay, so, so. Now come I to my father Father, your blessing: now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping: now should I kiss my father well, he weeps on. Now come I to my mother: O, that she could speak now like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her why, there tis heres my mothers breath up and down. Now come I to my sister mark the moan she makes. Now the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a word but see how I lay the dust with my tears."
