Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend, This night intends to steal away your daughter: Myself am one made privy to the plot. I know you have determined to bestow her On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates And should she thus be stoln away from you, It would be much vexation to your age. Thus, for my dutys sake, I rather chose To cross my friend in his intended drift Than, by concealing it, heap on your head A pack of sorrows which would press you down, Being unprevented, to your timeless grave."

My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them: While I, their king, that hither them importune, Do curse the grace that with such grace hath blessd them, Because myself do want my servants fortune: I curse myself, for they are sent by me, That they should harbour where their lord would be. Whats here Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee. Tis so and heres the ladder for the purpose. Why, Phaeton,for thou art Merops son, Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car And with thy daring folly burn the world Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee Go, base intruder! overweening slave! Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates, And think my patience, more than thy desert, Is privilege for thy departure hence: Thank me for this more than for all the favours Which all too much I have bestowd on thee. But if thou linger in my territories Longer than swiftest expedition Will give thee time to leave our royal court, By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love I ever bore my daughter or thyself. Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse But, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence."
