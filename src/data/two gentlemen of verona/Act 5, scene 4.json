This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods, I better brook than flourishing peopled towns: Here can I sit alone, unseen of any, And to the nightingales complaining notes Tune my distresses and record my woes. O thou that dost inhabit in my breast, Leave not the mansion so long tenantless, Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall And leave no memory of what it was! Repair me with thy presence, Silvia Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain! What halloing and what stir is this today These are my mates, that make their wills their law, Have some unhappy passenger in chase. They love me well yet I have much to do To keep them from uncivil outrages. Withdraw thee, Valentine: whos this comes here"
