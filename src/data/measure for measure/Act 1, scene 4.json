Upon his place, And with full line of his authority, Governs Lord Angelo a man whose blood Is very snowbroth one who never feels The wanton stings and motions of the sense, But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge With profits of the mind, study and fast. Heto give fear to use and liberty, Which have for long run by the hideous law, As mice by lionshath pickd out an act, Under whose heavy sense your brothers life Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it And follows close the rigour of the statute, To make him an example. All hope is gone, Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer To soften Angelo: and thats my pith of business Twixt you and your poor brother."
