No more the thirsty entrance of this soil Shall daub her lips with her own childrens blood Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields, Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes, Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven, All of one nature, of one substance bred, Did lately meet in the intestine shock And furious close of civil butchery Shall now, in mutual wellbeseeming ranks, March all one way and be no more opposed Against acquaintance, kindred and allies: The edge of war, like an illsheathed knife, No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends, As far as to the sepulchre of Christ, Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross We are impressed and engaged to fight, Forthwith a power of English shall we levy Whose arms were moulded in their mothers womb To chase these pagans in those holy fields Over whose acres walkd those blessed feet Which fourteen hundred years ago were naild For our advantage on the bitter cross. But this our purpose now is twelve month old, And bootless tis to tell you we will go: Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland, What yesternight our council did decree In forwarding this dear expedience."

Staind with the variation of each soil Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news. The Earl of Douglas is discomfited: Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights, Balkd in their own blood did Sir Walter see On Holmedons plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son To beaten Douglas and the Earl of Athol, Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith: And is not this an honourable spoil A gallant prize ha, cousin, is it not"

O that it could be proved That some nighttripping fairy had exchanged In cradleclothes our children where they lay, And calld mine Percy, his Plantagenet! Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.

What think you, coz, Of this young Percys pride the prisoners, Which he in this adventure hath surprised, To his own use he keeps and sends me word, I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife."
