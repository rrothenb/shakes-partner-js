Then it is thus: the passions of the mind, That have their first conception by misdread, Have afternourishment and life by care And what was first but fear what might be done, Grows elder now and cares it be not done. And so with me: the great Antiochus, Gainst whom I am too little to contend, Since hes so great can make his will his act, Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence Nor boots it me to say I honour him. If he suspect I may dishonour him: And what may make him blush in being known, Hell stop the course by which it might be known With hostile forces hell oerspread the land, And with the ostent of war will look so huge, Amazement shall drive courage from the state Our men be vanquishd ere they do resist, And subjects punishd that neer thought offence: Which care of them, not pity of myself, Who am no more but as the tops of trees, Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them, Makes both my body pine and soul to languish, And punish that before that he would punish."

When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace, He flatters you, makes war upon your life. Prince, pardon me, or strike me, if you please I cannot be much lower than my knees."

Attend me, then: I went to Antioch, Where as thou knowst, against the face of death, I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty. From whence an issue I might propagate, Are arms to princes, and bring joys to subjects. Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder The resthark in thine earas black as incest: Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father Seemd not to strike, but smooth: but thou knowst this, Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss. Such fear so grew in me, I hither fled, Under the covering of a careful night, Who seemd my good protector and, being here, Bethought me what was past, what might succeed. I knew him tyrannous and tyrants fears Decrease not, but grow faster than the years: And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth, That I should open to the listening air How many worthy princes bloods were shed, To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope, To lop that doubt, hell fill this land with arms, And make pretence of wrong that I have done him: When all, for mine, if I may call offence, Must feel wars blow, who spares not innocence: Which love to all, of which thyself art one, Who now reprovest me for it,"
