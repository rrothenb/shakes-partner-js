Now to Marina bend your mind, Whom our fastgrowing scene must find At Tarsus, and by Cleon traind In music, letters who hath gaind Of education all the grace, Which makes her both the heart and place Of general wonder. But, alack, That monster envy, oft the wrack Of earned praise, Marinas life Seeks to take off by treasons knife. And in this kind hath our Cleon One daughter, and a wench full grown, Even ripe for marriagerite this maid Hight Philoten: and it is said For certain in our story, she Would ever with Marina be: Bet when she weaved the sleided silk With fingers long, small, white as milk Or when she would with sharp needle wound The cambric, which she made more sound By hurting it or when to the lute She sung, and made the nightbird mute, That still records with moan or when She would with rich and constant pen Vail to her mistress Dian still This Philoten contends in skill With absolute Marina: so With the dove of Paphos might the crow Vie feathers white. Marina gets All praises, which are paid as debts, And not as given. This so darks In Philoten all graceful marks, That Cleons wife, with envy rare, A present murderer does prepare For good Marina, that her daughter Might stand peerless by this slaughter. The sooner her vile thoughts to stead, Lychorida, our nurse, is dead: And cursed Dionyza hath The pregnant instrument of wrath Prest for this blow. The unborn event I do commend to your content: Only I carry winged time Post on the lame feet of my rhyme Which never could I so convey, Unless your thoughts went on my way. Dionyza does appear, With Leonine, a murderer."
