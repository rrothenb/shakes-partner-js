She did disdain my child, and stood between Her and her fortunes: none would look on her, But cast their gazes on Marinas face Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin Not worth the time of day. It pierced me through And though you call my course unnatural, You not your child well loving, yet I find It greets me as an enterprise of kindness Performd to your sole daughter."
