Bring me the fairest creature northward born, Where Phoebus fire scarce thaws the icicles, And let us make incision for your love, To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine. I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine Hath feard the valiant: by my love I swear The bestregarded virgins of our clime Have loved it too: I would not change this hue, Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen."

By this scimitar That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince That won three fields of Sultan Solyman, I would outstare the sternest eyes that look, Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth, Pluck the young sucking cubs from the shebear, Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey, To win thee, lady. But, alas the while! If Hercules and Lichas play at dice Which is the better man, the greater throw May turn by fortune from the weaker hand: So is Alcides beaten by his page And so may I, blind fortune leading me, Miss that which one unworthier may attain, And die with grieving."
