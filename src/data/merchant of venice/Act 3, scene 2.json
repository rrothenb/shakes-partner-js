But lest you should not understand me well, And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought, I would detain you here some month or two Before you venture for me. I could teach you How to choose right, but I am then forsworn So will I never be: so may you miss me But if you do, youll make me wish a sin, That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes, They have oerlookd me and divided me One half of me is yours, the other half yours, Mine own, I would say but if mine, then yours, And so all yours. O, these naughty times Put bars between the owners and their rights! And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so, Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.

Now he goes, With no less presence, but with much more love, Than young Alcides, when he did redeem The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy To the seamonster: I stand for sacrifice The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives, With bleared visages, come forth to view The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules! Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay I view the fight than thou that makest the fray. SONG.

In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt, But, being seasoned with a gracious voice, Obscures the show of evil In religion, What damned error, but some sober brow Will bless it and approve it with a text, Hiding the grossness with fair ornament There is no vice so simple but assumes Some mark of virtue on his outward parts: How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars Who, inward searchd, have livers white as milk And these assume but valours excrement To render them redoubted! Look on beauty, And you shall see tis purchased by the weight Which therein works a miracle in nature, Making them lightest that wear most of it: So are those crisped snaky golden locks Which make such wanton gambols with the wind, Upon supposed fairness, often known To be the dowry of a second head, The skull that bred them in the sepulchre. Thus ornament is but the guiled shore To a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf Veiling an Indian beauty in a word, The seeming truth which cunning times put on To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold, Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead, Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught, Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence And here choose I joy be the consequence!"

Here in her hairs The painter plays the spider and hath woven A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men, Faster than gnats in cobwebs but her eyes, How could he see to do them having made one, Methinks it should have power to steal both his And leave itself unfurnishd. Yet look, how far The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow In underprizing it, so far this shadow Doth limp behind the substance. Heres the scroll, The continent and summary of my fortune. You that choose not by the view, Chance as fair and choose as true! Since this fortune falls to you, Be content and seek no new, If you be well pleased with this And hold your fortune for your bliss, Turn you where your lady is And claim her with a loving kiss. A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave I come by note, to give and to receive. Like one of two contending in a prize, That thinks he hath done well in peoples eyes, Hearing applause and universal shout, Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt Whether these pearls of praise be his or no So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so As doubtful whether what I see be true, Until confirmd, signd, ratified by you."
