Should I go to church And see the holy edifice of stone, And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks, Which touching but my gentle vessels side, Would scatter all her spices on the stream, Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks, And, in a word, but even now worth this, And now worth nothing Shall I have the thought To think on this, and shall I lack the thought That such a thing bechanced would make me sad But tell not me I know, Antonio Is sad to think upon his merchandise."

O my Antonio, I do know of these That therefore only are reputed wise For saying nothing when, I am very sure, If they should speak, would almost damn those ears, Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools. Ill tell thee more of this another time: But fish not, with this melancholy bait, For this fool gudgeon, this opinion. Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile: Ill end my exhortation after dinner."
