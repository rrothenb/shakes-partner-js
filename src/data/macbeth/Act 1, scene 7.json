But in these cases We still have judgment here that we but teach Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return To plague the inventor: this evenhanded justice Commends the ingredients of our poisond chalice To our own lips. Hes here in double trust First, as I am his kinsman and his subject, Strong both against the deed then, as his host, Who should against his murderer shut the door, Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been So clear in his great office, that his virtues Will plead like angels, trumpettongued, against The deep damnation of his takingoff And pity, like a naked newborn babe, Striding the blast, or heavens cherubim, horsed Upon the sightless couriers of the air, Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye, That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur To prick the sides of my intent, but only Vaulting ambition, which oerleaps itself And falls on the other. How now! what news"
