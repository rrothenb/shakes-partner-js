But make amends now: get you gone, And at the pit of Acheron Meet me i the morning: thither he Will come to know his destiny: Your vessels and your spells provide, Your charms and every thing beside. I am for the air this night Ill spend Unto a dismal and a fatal end: Great business must be wrought ere noon: Upon the corner of the moon There hangs a vaporous drop profound Ill catch it ere it come to ground: And that distilld by magic sleights Shall raise such artificial sprites As by the strength of their illusion Shall draw him on to his confusion: He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear He hopes bove wisdom, grace and fear: And you all know, security Is mortals chiefest enemy. Music and a song within: Come away, come away,  and c Hark! I am calld my little spirit, see, Sits in a foggy cloud, and stays for me."
