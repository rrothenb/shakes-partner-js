But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer, Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep In the affliction of these terrible dreams That shake us nightly: better be with the dead, Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace, Than on the torture of the mind to lie In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave After lifes fitful fever he sleeps well Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison, Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing, Can touch him further."

Come, seeling night, Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day And with thy bloody and invisible hand Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond Which keeps me pale! Light thickens and the crow Makes wing to the rooky wood: Good things of day begin to droop and drowse While nights black agents to their preys do rouse. Thou marvellst at my words: but hold thee still Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill. So, prithee, go with me."
