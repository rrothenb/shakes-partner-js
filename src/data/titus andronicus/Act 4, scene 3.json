Terras Astraea reliquit: Be you rememberd, Marcus, shes gone, shes fled. Sirs, take you to your tools. You, cousins, shall Go sound the ocean, and cast your nets Happily you may catch her in the sea Yet theres as little justice as at land: No Publius and Sempronius, you must do it Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade, And pierce the inmost centre of the earth: Then, when you come to Plutos region, I pray you, deliver him this petition Tell him, it is for justice and for aid, And that it comes from old Andronicus, Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome. Ah, Rome! Well, well I made thee miserable What time I threw the peoples suffrages On him that thus doth tyrannize oer me. Go, get you gone and pray be careful all, And leave you not a manofwar unsearchd: This wicked emperor may have shippd her hence And, kinsmen, then we may go pipe for justice."

Come, to this gear. You are a good archer, Marcus Ad Jovem, thats for you: here, Ad Apollinem: Ad Martem, thats for myself: Here, boy, to Pallas: here, to Mercury: To Saturn, Caius, not to Saturnine You were as good to shoot against the wind.
