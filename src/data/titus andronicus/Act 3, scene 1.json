For two and twenty sons I never wept, Because they died in honours lofty bed. Lieth down the Judges,  and c., pass by him, and Exeunt For these, these, tribunes, in the dust I write My hearts deep languor and my souls sad tears: Let my tears stanch the earths dry appetite My sons sweet blood will make it shame and blush. O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain, That shall distil from these two ancient urns, Than youthful April shall with all his showers: In summers drought Ill drop upon thee still In winter with warm tears Ill melt the snow And keep eternal springtime on thy face, So thou refuse to drink my dear sons blood. O reverend tribunes! O gentle, aged men! Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death And let me say, that never wept before, My tears are now prevailing orators."
