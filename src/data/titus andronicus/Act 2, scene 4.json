If I do wake, some planet strike me down, That I may slumber in eternal sleep! Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands Have loppd and hewd and made thy body bare Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments, Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in, And might not gain so great a happiness As have thy love Why dost not speak to me Alas, a crimson river of warm blood, Like to a bubbling fountain stirrd with wind, Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips, Coming and going with thy honey breath. But, sure, some Tereus hath deflowered thee, And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue. Ah, now thou turnst away thy face for shame! And, notwithstanding all this loss of blood, As from a conduit with three issuing spouts, Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titans face Blushing to be encountered with a cloud. Shall I speak for thee shall I say tis so O, that I knew thy heart and knew the beast, That I might rail at him, to ease my mind! Sorrow concealed, like an oven stoppd, Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is. Fair Philomela, she but lost her tongue, And in a tedious sampler sewd her mind: But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met, And he hath cut those pretty fingers off, That could have better sewd than Philomel. O, had the monster seen those lily hands Tremble, like aspenleaves, upon a lute, And make the silken strings delight to kiss them, He would not then have touchd them for his life! Or, had he heard the heavenly harmony Which that sweet tongue hath made, He would have droppd his knife, and fell asleep As Cerberus at the Thracian poets feet. Come, let us go, and make thy father blind For such a sight will blind a fathers eye: One hours storm will drown the fragrant meads What will whole months of tears thy fathers eyes Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee O, could our mourning ease thy misery!"
