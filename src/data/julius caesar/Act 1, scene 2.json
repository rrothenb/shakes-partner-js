I cannot tell what you and other men Think of this life but, for my single self, I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself. I was born free as Caesar so were you: We both have fed as well, and we can both Endure the winters cold as well as he: For once, upon a raw and gusty day, The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores, Caesar said to me Darest thou, Cassius, now Leap in with me into this angry flood, And swim to yonder point Upon the word, Accoutred as I was, I plunged in And bade him follow so indeed he did. The torrent roard, and we did buffet it With lusty sinews, throwing it aside And stemming it with hearts of controversy But ere we could arrive the point proposed, Caesar cried Help me, Cassius, or I sink! I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor, Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber Did I the tired Caesar. And this man Is now become a god, and Cassius is A wretched creature and must bend his body, If Caesar carelessly but nod on him. He had a fever when he was in Spain, And when the fit was on him, I did mark How he did shake: tis true, this god did shake His coward lips did from their colour fly, And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan: Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books, Alas, it cried Give me some drink, Titinius, As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the majestic world And bear the palm alone."

Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that Caesar Why should that name be sounded more than yours Write them together, yours is as fair a name Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well Weigh them, it is as heavy conjure with em, Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar. Now, in the names of all the gods at once, Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed, That he is grown so great Age, thou art shamed! Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods! When went there by an age, since the great flood, But it was famed with more than with one man When could they say till now, that talkd of Rome, That her wide walls encompassd but one man Now is it Rome indeed and room enough, When there is in it but one only man.
