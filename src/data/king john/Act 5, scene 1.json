Away, and glister like the god of war, When he intendeth to become the field: Show boldness and aspiring confidence. What, shall they seek the lion in his den, And fright him there and make him tremble there O, let it not be said: forage, and run To meet displeasure farther from the doors, And grapple with him ere he comes so nigh."
