Impute it not a crime To me or my swift passage, that I slide Oer sixteen years and leave the growth untried Of that wide gap, since it is in my power To oerthrow law and in one selfborn hour To plant and oerwhelm custom. Let me pass The same I am, ere ancientst order was Or what is now received: I witness to The times that brought them in so shall I do To the freshest things now reigning and make stale The glistering of this present, as my tale Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing, I turn my glass and give my scene such growing As you had slept between: Leontes leaving, The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving That he shuts up himself, imagine me, Gentle spectators, that I now may be In fair Bohemia, and remember well, I mentioned a son o the kings, which Florizel I now name to you and with speed so pace To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace Equal with wondering: what of her ensues I list not prophecy but let Times news Be known when tis brought forth. A shepherds daughter, And what to her adheres, which follows after, Is the argument of Time. Of this allow, If ever you have spent time worse ere now If never, yet that Time himself doth say He wishes earnestly you never may."
