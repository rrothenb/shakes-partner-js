To me comes a creature, Sometimes her head on one side, some another I never saw a vessel of like sorrow, So filld and so becoming: in pure white robes, Like very sanctity, she did approach My cabin where I lay thrice bowd before me, And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon Did this breakfrom her: Good Antigonus, Since fate, against thy better disposition, Hath made thy person for the throwerout Of my poor babe, according to thine oath, Places remote enough are in Bohemia, There weep and leave it crying and, for the babe Is counted lost for ever, Perdita, I prithee, callt. For this ungentle business Put on thee by my lord, thou neer shalt see Thy wife Paulina more. And so, with shrieks She melted into air. Affrighted much, I did in time collect myself and thought This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys: Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously, I will be squared by this. I do believe Hermione hath sufferd death, and that Apollo would, this being indeed the issue Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid, Either for life or death, upon the earth Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well! There lie, and there thy character: there these Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty, And still rest thine. The storm begins poor wretch, That for thy mothers fault art thus exposed To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot, But my heart bleeds and most accursed am I To be by oath enjoind to this. Farewell! The day frowns more and more: thourt like to have A lullaby too rough: I never saw The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour! Well may I get aboard! This is the chase: I am gone for ever."

But to make an end of the ship, to see how the sea flapdragoned it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the sea mocked them and how the poor gentleman roared and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than the sea or weather."
