But this rough magic I here abjure, and, when I have required Some heavenly music, which even now I do, To work mine end upon their senses that This airy charm is for, Ill break my staff, Bury it certain fathoms in the earth, And deeper than did ever plummet sound Ill drown my book. A solemn air and the best comforter To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains, Now useless, boild within thy skull! There stand, For you are spellstoppd. Holy Gonzalo, honourable man, Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine, Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace, And as the morning steals upon the night, Melting the darkness, so their rising senses Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo, My true preserver, and a loyal sir To him you followst! I will pay thy graces Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter: Thy brother was a furtherer in the act. Thou art pinchd fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood, You, brother mine, that entertaind ambition, Expelld remorse and nature who, with Sebastian, Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong, Would here have killd your king I do forgive thee, Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding Begins to swell, and the approaching tide Will shortly fill the reasonable shore That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them That yet looks on me, or would know me Ariel, Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell: I will discase me, and myself present As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit Thou shalt ere long be free. Where the bee sucks. there suck I: In a cowslips bell I lie There I couch when owls do cry. On the bats back I do fly After summer merrily. Merrily, merrily shall I live now Under the blossom that hangs on the bough. Why, thats my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee: But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so. To the kings ship, invisible as thou art: There shalt thou find the mariners asleep Under the hatches the master and the boatswain Being awake, enforce them to this place, And presently, I prithee."

My Ariel, chick, That is thy charge: then to the elements Be free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near. EPILOGUE SPOKEN BY PROSPERO Now my charms are all oerthrown, And what strength I haves mine own, Which is most faint: now, tis true, I must be here confined by you, Or sent to Naples. Let me not, Since I have my dukedom got And pardond the deceiver, dwell In this bare island by your spell But release me from my bands With the help of your good hands: Gentle breath of yours my sails Must fill, or else my project fails, Which was to please. Now I want Spirits to enforce, art to enchant, And my ending is despair, Unless I be relieved by prayer, Which pierces so that it assaults Mercy itself and frees all faults. As you from crimes would pardond be, Let your indulgence set me free."
