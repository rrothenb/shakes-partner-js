And now what rests but, in nights coverture, Thy brother being carelessly encampd, His soldiers lurking in the towns about, And but attended by a simple guard, We may surprise and take him at our pleasure Our scouts have found the adventure very easy: That as Ulysses and stout Diomede With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus tents, And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds, So we, well coverd with the nights black mantle, At unawares may beat down Edwards guard And seize himself I say not, slaughter him, For I intend but only to surprise him. You that will follow me to this attempt, Applaud the name of Henry with your leader. They all cry, Henry! Why, then, lets on our way in silent sort: For Warwick and his friends, God and Saint George!"
