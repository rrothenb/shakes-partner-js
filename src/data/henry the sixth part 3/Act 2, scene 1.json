Methought he bore him in the thickest troop As doth a lion in a herd of neat Or as a bear, encompassd round with dogs, Who having pinchd a few and made them cry, The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him. So fared our father with his enemies So fled his enemies my warlike father: Methinks, tis prize enough to be his son. See how the morning opes her golden gates, And takes her farewell of the glorious sun! How well resembles it the prime of youth, Trimmd like a younker prancing to his love!"

By many hands your father was subdued But only slaughterd by the ireful arm Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen, Who crownd the gracious duke in high despite, Laughd in his face and when with grief he wept, The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks A napkin steeped in the harmless blood Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain: And after many scorns, many foul taunts, They took his head, and on the gates of York They set the same and there it doth remain, The saddest spectacle that eer I viewd."

After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought, Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp, Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run, Were brought me of your loss and his depart. I, then in London keeper of the king, Musterd my soldiers, gatherd flocks of friends, And very well appointed, as I thought, Marchd toward Saint Albans to intercept the queen, Bearing the king in my behalf along For by my scouts I was advertised That she was coming with a full intent To dash our late decree in parliament Touching King Henrys oath and your succession. Short tale to make, we at Saint Albans met Our battles joind, and both sides fiercely fought: But whether twas the coldness of the king, Who lookd full gently on his warlike queen, That robbd my soldiers of their heated spleen Or whether twas report of her success Or more than common fear of Cliffords rigour, Who thunders to his captives blood and death, I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth, Their weapons like to lightning came and went Our soldiers, like the nightowls lazy flight, Or like an idle thresher with a flail, Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends. I cheerd them up with justice of our cause, With promise of high pay and great rewards: But all in vain they had no heart to fight, And we in them no hope to win the day So that we fled the king unto the queen Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself, In haste, posthaste, are come to join with you: For in the marches here we heard you were, Making another head to fight again."

Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong: Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself, With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March, Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure, Will but amount to five and twenty thousand, Why, Via! to London will we march amain, And once again bestride our foaming steeds, And once again cry Charge upon our foes!
