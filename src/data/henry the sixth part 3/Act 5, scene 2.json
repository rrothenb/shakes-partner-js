That I must yield my body to the earth And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe. Thus yields the cedar to the axes edge, Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle, Under whose shade the ramping lion slept, Whose topbranch overpeerd Joves spreading tree And kept low shrubs from winters powerful wind. These eyes, that now are dimmd with deaths black veil, Have been as piercing as the midday sun, To search the secret treasons of the world: The wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood, Were likend oft to kingly sepulchres For who lived king, but I could dig his grave And who durst mine when Warwick bent his brow Lo, now my glory smeard in dust and blood! My parks, my walks, my manors that I had. Even now forsake me, and of all my lands Is nothing left me but my bodys length. Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust And, live we how we can, yet die we must."
