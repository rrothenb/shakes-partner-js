Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea Forced by the tide to combat with the wind Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea Forced to retire by fury of the wind: Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind Now one the better, then another best Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast, Yet neither conqueror nor conquered: So is the equal of this fell war. Here on this molehill will I sit me down. To whom God will, there be the victory! For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too, Have chid me from the battle swearing both They prosper best of all when I am thence. Would I were dead! if Gods good will were so For what is in this world but grief and woe O God! methinks it were a happy life, To be no better than a homely swain To sit upon a hill, as I do now, To carve out dials quaintly, point by point, Thereby to see the minutes how they run, How many make the hour full complete How many hours bring about the day How many days will finish up the year How many years a mortal man may live. When this is known, then to divide the times: So many hours must I tend my flock So many hours must I take my rest So many hours must I contemplate So many hours must I sport myself So many days my ewes have been with young So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean: So many years ere I shall shear the fleece: So minutes, hours, days, months, and years, Passd over to the end they were created, Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave. Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely! Gives not the hawthornbush a sweeter shade To shepherds looking on their silly sheep, Than doth a rich embroiderd canopy To kings that fear their subjects treachery O, yes, it doth a thousandfold it doth. And to conclude, the shepherds homely curds, His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle. His wonted sleep under a fresh trees shade, All which secure and sweetly he enjoys, Is far beyond a princes delicates, His viands sparkling in a golden cup, His body couched in a curious bed, When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him."

This man, whom hand to hand I slew in fight, May be possessed with some store of crowns And I, that haply take them from him now, May yet ere night yield both my life and them To some man else, as this dead man doth me. Whos this O God! it is my fathers face, Whom in this conflict I unwares have killd. O heavy times, begetting such events! From London by the king was I pressd forth My father, being the Earl of Warwicks man, Came on the part of York, pressd by his master And I, who at his hands received my life, him Have by my hands of life bereaved him. Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did! And pardon, father, for I knew not thee! My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks And no more words till they have flowd their fill."

O, pity, God, this miserable age! What stratagems, how fell, how butcherly, Erroneous, mutinous and unnatural, This deadly quarrel daily doth beget! O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon, And hath bereft thee of thy life too late!"
