My sons, God knows what hath bechanced them: But this I know, they have demeand themselves Like men born to renown by life or death. Three times did Richard make a lane to me. And thrice cried Courage, father! fight it out! And full as oft came Edward to my side, With purple falchion, painted to the hilt In blood of those that had encounterd him: And when the hardiest warriors did retire, Richard cried Charge! and give no foot of ground! And cried A crown, or else a glorious tomb! A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre! With this, we charged again: but, out, alas! We bodged again as I have seen a swan With bootless labour swim against the tide And spend her strength with overmatching waves. Ah, hark! the fatal followers do pursue And I am faint and cannot fly their fury: And were I strong, I would not shun their fury: The sands are numberd that make up my life Here must I stay, and here my life must end. Come, bloody Clifford, rough Northumberland, I dare your quenchless fury to more rage: I am your butt, and I abide your shot."

What! was it you that would be Englands king Wast you that revelld in our parliament, And made a preachment of your high descent Where are your mess of sons to back you now The wanton Edward, and the lusty George And wheres that valiant crookback prodigy, Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland Look, York: I staind this napkin with the blood That valiant Clifford, with his rapiers point, Made issue from the bosom of the boy And if thine eyes can water for his death, I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal. Alas poor York! but that I hate thee deadly, I should lament thy miserable state. I prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York. What, hath thy fiery heart so parchd thine entrails That not a tear can fall for Rutlands death Why art thou patient, man thou shouldst be mad And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus. Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance. Thou wouldst be feed, I see, to make me sport: York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown. A crown for York! and, lords, bow low to him: Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on. Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king! Ay, this is he that took King Henrys chair, And this is he was his adopted heir. But how is it that great Plantagenet Is crownd so soon, and broke his solemn oath As I bethink me, you should not be king Till our King Henry had shook hands with death. And will you pale your head in Henrys glory, And rob his temples of the diadem, Now in his life, against your holy oath O, tis a fault too too unpardonable! Off with the crown, and with the crown his head And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead."

How illbeseeming is it in thy sex To triumph, like an Amazonian trull, Upon their woes whom fortune captivates! But that thy face is, vizardlike, unchanging, Made impudent with use of evil deeds, I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush. To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived, Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless. Thy father bears the type of King of Naples, Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem, Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman. Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen, Unless the adage must be verified, That beggars mounted run their horse to death. Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small: Tis virtue that doth make them most admired The contrary doth make thee wonderd at: Tis government that makes them seem divine The want thereof makes thee abominable: Thou art as opposite to every good As the Antipodes are unto us, Or as the south to the septentrion. O tigers heart wrapt in a womans hide! How couldst thou drain the lifeblood of the child, To bid the father wipe his eyes withal, And yet be seen to bear a womans face Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless. Bidst thou me rage why, now thou hast thy wish: Wouldst have me weep why, now thou hast thy will: For raging wind blows up incessant showers, And when the rage allays, the rain begins. These tears are my sweet Rutlands obsequies: And every drop cries vengeance for his death, Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false Frenchwoman."

Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this: And if thou tellst the heavy story right, Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears Yea even my foes will shed fastfalling tears, And say Alas, it was a piteous deed! There, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse And in thy need such comfort come to thee As now I reap at thy too cruel hand! Hardhearted Clifford, take me from the world: My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads!"
