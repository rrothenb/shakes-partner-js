Never alone Did the king sigh, but with a general groan."

Fare you well, my liege: Ill call upon you ere you go to bed, And tell you what I know."

Pray can I not, Though inclination be as sharp as will: My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent And, like a man to double business bound, I stand in pause where I shall first begin, And both neglect. What if this cursed hand Were thicker than itself with brothers blood, Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens To wash it white as snow Whereto serves mercy But to confront the visage of offence And whats in prayer but this twofold force, To be forestalled ere we come to fall, Or pardond being down Then Ill look up My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer Can serve my turn Forgive me my foul murder That cannot be since I am still possessd Of those effects for which I did the murder, My crown, mine own ambition and my queen. May one be pardond and retain the offence In the corrupted currents of this world Offences gilded hand may shove by justice, And oft tis seen the wicked prize itself Buys out the law: but tis not so above There is no shuffling, there the action lies In his true nature and we ourselves compelld, Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults, To give in evidence. What then what rests Try what repentance can: what can it not Yet what can it when one can not repent O wretched state! O bosom black as death! O limed soul, that, struggling to be free, Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay! Bow, stubborn knees and, heart with strings of steel, Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe! All may be well."

That would be scannd: A villain kills my father and for that, I, his sole son, do this same villain send To heaven. O, this is hire and salary, not revenge. He took my father grossly, full of bread With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May And how his audit stands who knows save heaven But in our circumstance and course of thought, Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged, To take him in the purging of his soul, When he is fit and seasond for his passage No! Up, sword and know thou a more horrid hent: When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage, Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed At gaming, swearing, or about some act That has no relish of salvation int Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven, And that his soul may be as damnd and black As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays: This physic but prolongs thy sickly days."
