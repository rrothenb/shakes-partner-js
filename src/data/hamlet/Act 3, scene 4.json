Look you now, what follows: Here is your husband like a mildewd ear, Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed, And batten on this moor Ha! have you eyes You cannot call it love for at your age The heyday in the blood is tame, its humble, And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment Would step from this to this Sense, sure, you have, Else could you not have motion but sure, that sense Is apoplexd for madness would not err, Nor sense to ecstasy was neer so thralld But it reserved some quantity of choice, To serve in such a difference. What devil wast That thus hath cozend you at hoodmanblind Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight, Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all, Or but a sickly part of one true sense Could not so mope. O shame! where is thy blush Rebellious hell, If thou canst mutine in a matrons bones, To flaming youth let virtue be as wax, And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame When the compulsive ardour gives the charge, Since frost itself as actively doth burn And reason panders will."
