Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded them: on the instant they got clear of our ship so I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they did I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king have the letters I have sent and repair thou to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England: of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell. He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET. Come, I will make you way for these your letters And dot the speedier, that you may direct me To him from whom you brought them."
