Now, sir, young Fortinbras, Of unimproved mettle hot and full, Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there Sharkd up a list of lawless resolutes, For food and diet, to some enterprise That hath a stomach int which is no other As it doth well appear unto our state But to recover of us, by strong hand And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands So by his father lost: and this, I take it, Is the main motive of our preparations, The source of this our watch and the chief head Of this posthaste and romage in the land."
