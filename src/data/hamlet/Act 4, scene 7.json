The other motive, Why to a public count I might not go, Is the great love the general gender bear him Who, dipping all his faults in their affection, Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone, Convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows, Too slightly timberd for so loud a wind, Would have reverted to my bow again, And not where I had aimd them."
