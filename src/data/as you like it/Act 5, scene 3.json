Between the acres of the rye, With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino These pretty country folks would lie, In spring time,  and c. This carol they began that hour, With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino, How that a life was but a flower In spring time,  and c. And therefore take the present time, With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino; For love is crowned with the prime In spring time,  and c."
