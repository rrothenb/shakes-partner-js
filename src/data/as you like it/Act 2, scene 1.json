Sweet are the uses of adversity, Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous, Wears yet a precious jewel in his head And this our life exempt from public haunt Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, Sermons in stones and good in every thing. I would not change it."

Today my Lord of Amiens and myself Did steal behind him as he lay along Under an oak whose antique root peeps out Upon the brook that brawls along this wood: To the which place a poor sequesterd stag, That from the hunters aim had taen a hurt, Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord, The wretched animal heaved forth such groans That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat Almost to bursting, and the big round tears Coursed one another down his innocent nose In piteous chase and thus the hairy fool Much marked of the melancholy Jaques, Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook, Augmenting it with tears."

First, for his weeping into the needless stream Poor deer, quoth he, thou makest a testament As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more To that which had too much: then, being there alone, Left and abandond of his velvet friends, Tis right: quoth he thus misery doth part The flux of company: anon a careless herd, Full of the pasture, jumps along by him And never stays to greet him Ay quoth Jaques, Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there Thus most invectively he pierceth through The body of the country, city, court, Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we Are mere usurpers, tyrants and whats worse, To fright the animals and to kill them up In their assignd and native dwellingplace."
