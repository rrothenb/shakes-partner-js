Thou tellst me there is murder in mine eye: Tis pretty, sure, and very probable, That eyes, that are the frailst and softest things, Who shut their coward gates on atomies, Should be calld tyrants, butchers, murderers! Now I do frown on thee with all my heart And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee: Now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame, Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers! Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee: Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains Some scar of it lean but upon a rush, The cicatrice and capable impressure Thy palm some moment keeps but now mine eyes, Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not, Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes That can do hurt."

Ods my little life, I think she means to tangle my eyes too! No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it: Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair, Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream, That can entame my spirits to your worship. You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her, Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain You are a thousand times a properer man Than she a woman: tis such fools as you That makes the world full of illfavourd children: Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her And out of you she sees herself more proper Than any of her lineaments can show her. But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees, And thank heaven, fasting, for a good mans love: For I must tell you friendly in your ear, Sell when you can: you are not for all markets: Cry the man mercy love him take his offer: Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer. So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well."

He is not very tall yet for his years hes tall: His leg is but so so and yet tis well: There was a pretty redness in his lip, A little riper and more lusty red Than that mixd in his cheek twas just the difference Between the constant red and mingled damask. There be some women, Silvius, had they markd him In parcels as I did, would have gone near To fall in love with him but, for my part, I love him not nor hate him not and yet I have more cause to hate him than to love him: For what had he to do to chide at me He said mine eyes were black and my hair black: And, now I am rememberd, scornd at me: I marvel why I answerd not again: But thats all one omittance is no quittance. Ill write to him a very taunting letter, And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius"
