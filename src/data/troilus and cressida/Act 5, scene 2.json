Instance, O instance! strong as Plutos gates Cressid is mine, tied with the bonds of heaven: Instance, O instance! strong as heaven itself The bonds of heaven are slippd, dissolved, and loosed And with another knot, fivefingertied, The fractions of her faith, orts of her love, The fragments, scraps, the bits and greasy relics Of her oereaten faith, are bound to Diomed."

Hark, Greek: as much as I do Cressid love, So much by weight hate I her Diomed: That sleeve is mine that hell bear on his helm Were it a casque composed by Vulcans skill, My sword should bite it: not the dreadful spout Which shipmen do the hurricano call, Constringed in mass by the almighty sun, Shall dizzy with more clamour Neptunes ear In his descent than shall my prompted sword Falling on Diomed."
