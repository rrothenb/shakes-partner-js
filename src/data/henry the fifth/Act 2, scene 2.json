See you, my princes, and my noble peers, These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here, You know how apt our love was to accord To furnish him with all appertinents Belonging to his honour and this man Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired, And sworn unto the practises of France, To kill us here in Hampton: to the which This knight, no less for bounty bound to us Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But, O, What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop thou cruel, Ingrateful, savage and inhuman creature! Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels, That knewst the very bottom of my soul, That almost mightst have coind me into gold, Wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use, May it be possible, that foreign hire Could out of thee extract one spark of evil That might annoy my finger tis so strange, That, though the truth of it stands off as gross As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it. Treason and murder ever kept together, As two yokedevils sworn to eithers purpose, Working so grossly in a natural cause, That admiration did not whoop at them: But thou, gainst all proportion, didst bring in Wonder to wait on treason and on murder: And whatsoever cunning fiend it was That wrought upon thee so preposterously Hath got the voice in hell for excellence: All other devils that suggest by treasons Do botch and bungle up damnation With patches, colours, and with forms being fetchd From glistering semblances of piety But he that temperd thee bade thee stand up, Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason, Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor. If that same demon that hath gulld thee thus Should with his lion gait walk the whole world, He might return to vasty Tartar back, And tell the legions I can never win A soul so easy as that Englishmans. O, how hast thou with jealousy infected The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful Why, so didst thou: seem they grave and learned Why, so didst thou: come they of noble family Why, so didst thou: seem they religious Why, so didst thou: or are they spare in diet, Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger, Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood, Garnishd and deckd in modest complement, Not working with the eye without the ear, And but in purged judgment trusting neither Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem: And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot, To mark the fullfraught man and best indued With some suspicion. I will weep for thee For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like Another fall of man. Their faults are open: Arrest them to the answer of the law And God acquit them of their practises!"

Touching our person seek we no revenge But we our kingdoms safety must so tender, Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence, Poor miserable wretches, to your death: The taste whereof, God of his mercy give You patience to endure, and true repentance Of all your dear offences! Bear them hence. Now, lords, for France the enterprise whereof Shall be to you, as us, like glorious. We doubt not of a fair and lucky war, Since God so graciously hath brought to light This dangerous treason lurking in our way To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now But every rub is smoothed on our way. Then forth, dear countrymen: let us deliver Our puissance into the hand of God, Putting it straight in expedition. Cheerly to sea the signs of war advance: No king of England, if not king of France."
