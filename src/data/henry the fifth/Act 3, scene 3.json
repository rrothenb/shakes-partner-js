The gates of mercy shall be all shut up, And the fleshd soldier, rough and hard of heart, In liberty of bloody hand shall range With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass Your freshfair virgins and your flowering infants. What is it then to me, if impious war, Arrayd in flames like to the prince of fiends, Do, with his smirchd complexion, all fell feats Enlinkd to waste and desolation What ist to me, when you yourselves are cause, If your pure maidens fall into the hand Of hot and forcing violation What rein can hold licentious wickedness When down the hill he holds his fierce career We may as bootless spend our vain command Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil As send precepts to the leviathan To come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur, Take pity of your town and of your people, Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace Oerblows the filthy and contagious clouds Of heady murder, spoil and villany. If not, why, in a moment look to see The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand Defile the locks of your shrillshrieking daughters Your fathers taken by the silver beards, And their most reverend heads dashd to the walls, Your naked infants spitted upon pikes, Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry At Herods bloodyhunting slaughtermen. What say you will you yield, and this avoid, Or, guilty in defence, be thus destroyd"
