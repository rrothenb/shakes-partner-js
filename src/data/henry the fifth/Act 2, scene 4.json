Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Bretagne, Of Brabant and of Orleans, shall make forth, And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch, To line and new repair our towns of war With men of courage and with means defendant For England his approaches makes as fierce As waters to the sucking of a gulf. It fits us then to be as provident As fear may teach us out of late examples Left by the fatal and neglected English Upon our fields."

Therefore, I say tis meet we all go forth To view the sick and feeble parts of France: And let us do it with no show of fear No, with no more than if we heard that England Were busied with a Whitsun morrisdance: For, my good liege, she is so idly kingd, Her sceptre so fantastically borne By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth, That fear attends her not."

You are too much mistaken in this king: Question your grace the late ambassadors, With what great state he heard their embassy, How well supplied with noble counsellors, How modest in exception, and withal How terrible in constant resolution, And you shall find his vanities forespent Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus, Covering discretion with a coat of folly As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots That shall first spring and be most delicate."

The kindred of him hath been fleshd upon us And he is bred out of that bloody strain That haunted us in our familiar paths: Witness our too much memorable shame When Cressy battle fatally was struck, And all our princes captivd by the hand Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales Whiles that his mountain sire, on mountain standing, Up in the air, crownd with the golden sun, Saw his heroical seed, and smiled to see him, Mangle the work of nature and deface The patterns that by God and by French fathers Had twenty years been made. This is a stem Of that victorious stock and let us fear The native mightiness and fate of him."

Suppose that you have seen The wellappointed king at Hampton pier Embark his royalty and his brave fleet With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning: Play with your fancies, and in them behold Upon the hempen tackle shipboys climbing Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give To sounds confused behold the threaden sails, Borne with the invisible and creeping wind, Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowd sea, Breasting the lofty surge: O, do but think You stand upon the ravage and behold A city on the inconstant billows dancing For so appears this fleet majestical, Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow: Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy, And leave your England, as dead midnight still, Guarded with grandsires, babies and old women, Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance For who is he, whose chin is but enrichd With one appearing hair, that will not follow These culld and choicedrawn cavaliers to France Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege Behold the ordnance on their carriages, With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur. Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back Tells Harry that the king doth offer him Katharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry, Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms. The offer likes not: and the nimble gunner With linstock now the devilish cannon touches, And down goes all before them. Still be kind, And eke out our performance with your mind."
