Now we bear the king Toward Calais: grant him there there seen, Heave him away upon your winged thoughts Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach Pales in the flood with men, with wives and boys, Whose shouts and claps outvoice the deep mouthd sea, Which like a mighty whiffler fore the king Seems to prepare his way: so let him land, And solemnly see him set on to London. So swift a pace hath thought that even now You may imagine him upon Blackheath Where that his lords desire him to have borne His bruised helmet and his bended sword Before him through the city: he forbids it, Being free from vainness and selfglorious pride Giving full trophy, signal and ostent Quite from himself to God. But now behold, In the quick forge and workinghouse of thought, How London doth pour out her citizens! The mayor and all his brethren in best sort, Like to the senators of the antique Rome, With the plebeians swarming at their heels, Go forth and fetch their conquering Caesar in: As, by a lower but loving likelihood, Were now the general of our gracious empress, As in good time he may, from Ireland coming, Bringing rebellion broached on his sword, How many would the peaceful city quit, To welcome him! much more, and much more cause, Did they this Harry. Now in London place him As yet the lamentation of the French Invites the King of Englands stay at home The emperors coming in behalf of France, To order peace between them and omit All the occurrences, whatever chanced, Till Harrys backreturn again to France: There must we bring him and myself have playd The interim, by remembering you tis past. Then brook abridgment, and your eyes advance, After your thoughts, straight back again to France."
