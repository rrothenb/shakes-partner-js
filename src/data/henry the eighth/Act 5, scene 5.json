Though in her cradle, yet now promises Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings, Which time shall bring to ripeness: she shall be But few now living can behold that goodness A pattern to all princes living with her, And all that shall succeed: Saba was never More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue Than this pure soul shall be: all princely graces, That mould up such a mighty piece as this is, With all the virtues that attend the good, Shall still be doubled on her: truth shall nurse her, Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her: She shall be loved and feard: her own shall bless her Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn, And hang their heads with sorrow: good grows with her: In her days every man shall eat in safety, Under his own vine, what he plants and sing The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours: God shall be truly known and those about her From her shall read the perfect ways of honour, And by those claim their greatness, not by blood. Nor shall this peace sleep with her: but as when The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix, Her ashes new create another heir, As great in admiration as herself So shall she leave her blessedness to one, When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness, Who from the sacred ashes of her honour Shall starlike rise, as great in fame as she was, And so stand fixd: peace, plenty, love, truth, terror, That were the servants to this chosen infant, Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him: Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine, His honour and the greatness of his name Shall be, and make new nations: he shall flourish, And, like a mountain cedar, reach his branches To all the plains about him: our childrens children Shall see this, and bless heaven."

I thank ye all. To you, my good lord mayor, And your good brethren, I am much beholding I have received much honour by your presence, And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords: Ye must all see the queen, and she must thank ye, She will be sick else. This day, no man think Has business at his house for all shall stay: This little one shall make it holiday. EPILOGUE Tis ten to one this play can never please All that are here: some come to take their ease, And sleep an act or two but those, we fear, We have frighted with our trumpets so, tis clear, Theyll say tis naught: others, to hear the city Abused extremely, and to cry Thats witty! Which we have not done neither: that, I fear, All the expected good were like to hear For this play at this time, is only in The merciful construction of good women For such a one we showd em: if they smile, And say twill do, I know, within a while All the best men are ours for tis ill hap, If they hold when their ladies bid em clap."
